## Reading documentation

At the beginning of sessions, you should explore the `.context/` folder.

## Writing Documentation

You should update or write new documentation with this process:

1. Use `context status` to find stale documents.
2. Author up-to-date documentation based on `git diff HEAD`
3. Mark the documentation as valid with `context sync`
